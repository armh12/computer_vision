Dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/puneet6060/intel-image-classification

This is my first project in field of Computer Vision.I have made simple classification of images with Tensorflow framework and Keras API.I have used Convolutional Neural Networks and regularization techniques, like image augmentation.
