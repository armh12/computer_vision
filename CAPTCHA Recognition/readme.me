CAPCTHA recognition with Convolutional Neural Networks from Tensorflow framework.Data source - Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fournierp/captcha-version-2-images/
Preprocess have been made with OpenCV library.Included pixel thresholding, line removing from images, blur adding and seperating every character to single image.Actually, model was predicting every character from captcha.In the end, I have implemented some functions for predcting labels for every image.
Accuracy of predicting is 88%, total misslcassified images count is 240 from 1039 images.
