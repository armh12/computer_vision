This is a segmentation of images from Oxford III Pet dataset.Dataset was loaded from Tensorflow.
Here, I have used U-Net construction for segmentation.I have implemented encoder and decoder blocks for making operations and custom construction for realising U-Net.Cause it's my first project in field of segmentation, I have used Tensorflow guide for segmentation.Results are given in notebook.
